Q. why we can't use 'continue' in 'switch' statement?
ANS:    Switch has flow such that if any case matches, then this case's block come into flow 
and if the break statement is not there to indicate the end of this case, every case below this case would come into flow, 
until another break. So, as you can see there seems to be no use of continue here.

    Continue is specifically used in loops for not executing statements after it without breaking out of that loop. 
When the continue statement is executed, it just starts the loop in its next iteration.
